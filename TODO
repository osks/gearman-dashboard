Ideas:

- URL: /hosts/$ip (ex: /hosts/127.0.0.1)
  
  List all workers *and* clients from that IP, with suitable
  information. Basically a status page for a host that is using Gearman.

- URL: /servers/$ip/$port/$function (ex: /servers/localhost/4730/reverse)
  
  List background jobs in the database (only mysql to start with) with
  that function. (limit to something like 20 or so). Foreground jobs
  won't be listed, since they are not persisted to the database.
  
  This page will rely on further information about how the gearman
  server is configured, since we do not have access to the storage
  normally.

- URL: /servers

  List server information. Not much, but version number is available,
  and perhaps we can summarize something about the pending jobs or
  such. It could possibly be the new Overview page, and might be more
  suitable if you have many servers and/or so many functions/workers
  that the Overview page gets too messy.
